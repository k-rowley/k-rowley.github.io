    <p>I just got started here at Github mainly because I teach HTML/CSS and am looking for a web hosting platform to publish student work. Over the past year, I've gone from using free web hosts such as <a href="https://fastcomet.com/" target="_blank">FastComet</a> to using the online IDE <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">Replit</a>. But it appears that Replit has now made their hosting a paid service.</p>
    <p>Then last week, I had a student submit their work with a Github URL, and that's when I realized that Github is not just for hosting application development projects, but also HTML/CSS projects.</p>
    <p>I like the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop app</a>, which is kind of like an FTP program, which uploads one's local code to one's GitHub repository. It's actually easier to use than an FTP program, because it really just syncs local changes with the repository, and one doesn't have to make sure to *manually* upload locally-edited files -- the Desktop app keeps track of locally-changed files and then uploads those upon command.</p>
